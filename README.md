## Overview and Origin

* Name of Company  
    - Blue River Technology

* When was the company incorporated? 
    - 2011

* Who are the founders of the company? 
    - **Jorge Heraud** - Stanford University graduate who headed Precision Agriculture Group at Trimble Navigation for 15 years before founding Blue River Technology
    - **Lee Redden** - Also a Stanford University graduate with research experience at robotics labs at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, NASA Johnson Space Center, and Stanford University

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?  
    - Jorge Heraud and Lee Redden met while taking a Steve Blank's Lean Launchpad course at Stanford University, a course focused on using a framework to test a business model of a startup. From that course, Jorge and Lee came together with the idea to make farming more sustainable through robotics and computer vision

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?  
    - On September 12, 2017 Blue River Technology was acquired by John Deere for $284 milliom

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?  
    - The company seeks to deliver agriculture products with enabled technologies to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and profitability for farmers

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  
  -The intended customer are all farmers globally.
     >"It's estimated that there are around 570 million farms in the world" (Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2022) - “Farm Size and Productivity” Published online at OurWorldInData.org. Retrieved from: 'https://ourworldindata.org/farm-size' [Online Resource])

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  - Blue River Technology is part of the John Deere, which gives them an advantage on the machinery side as John Deere has almost 200 years of experience in agriculture
  - The main product from Blue River Technology is the See and Spray Technology, which is used for weed control for major U.S. crops and allows for plant-by-plant precision.
  -  With John Deere, Blue River Technology offers a Dual Tank System working in conjunction with See and Spray technology allowing the farmer to use two different herbicides in one pass based on plant needs

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
  - Within the See and Spray technology the following technologies are being used:
    - *Computer Vision - used to detect crops and weeds and produces a pixel-accurate map of the location of weeds*
    - *Machine Learning Models - used to identify weeds and crops based on images of crops and weeds collected over more than 5 years*
    - *Robotics - used to drive intelligent sprayer through fields and spray weed while leaving crops intact.  Cameras are used on the sprayer to monitor field roughness, rocks, and bumps and adjust the spray accordingly*
    - *Deep Learning Algorighms - paired with computer vision system*

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
  - **Agriculture**

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

  >"Technology advancement has allowed U.S. farmers to produce more crops and livestock while using less labor and land. From 1948 to 2019, the quantity of farm labor used in the production of U.S. agricultural commodities fell by three-fourths and land use declined by a fourth. During the same time, U.S. agricultural production rose to about 2.7 times its 1948 level. The mix of input use on farms over the past 70 years has shifted away from labor and land and toward captial inputs such as machinery, farm structures (chicken houses and greenhouses, for example), and intermediate inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides, and purchased services." (Sun Ling Wang, Roberto Mosheim, Eric Njuki, and Richard Nehring (October 27, 2022) - "U.S. Agricultural Output Has Grown Slower in Response to Stagnant Productivity Growth" Published online at USDA.gov.

  >"Over the years, technologocal changes have made inputs such as machinery and agricultural chemicals more affordable for farmers and have partially replaced labor and land inputs in the production process" (Sun Ling Wang, Roberto Mosheim, Eric Njuki, and Richard Nehring (October 27, 2022) - "U.S. Agricultural Output Has Grown Slower in Response to Stagnant Productivity Growth" Published online at USDA.gov. Retrieved from ['USDA.gov](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/october/u-s-agricultural-output-has-grown-slower-in-response-to-stagnant-productivity-growth/#:~:text=Over%20the%20years%2C%20technological%20changes,farm%20sector%20to%20other%20sectors.))

  - The last five years have shown advancements in the following, which has enabled incredible strides towards building a more productive and resilient food system.
    - *Machine - enhanced machine designs help increase yields and sustainability*
    - *Automation - technologies using a combination of robotics and sensors in the equipment* 
    - *Digital - sensor readings on machines are gathered for documentation and traceability of field practices enabling farmers to evaluate productivity and yields*

* What are the other major companies in this field?
  - Carbon Robotics - utilizing agricultural technology for advanced weed control solutions with products such as Autonomous LaserWeeder
  - Ekobot - develops and sells autonomous agricultural robots for the precision agruculture industry for weed control
  - FarmWise - utilizes agricultural technology for automated weeding and cultivation solutions

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  - Blue River Technology has developed See & Spray machines, which utilize cameras and machine learning to enable plant-by-plant spray treatments. The result of the precision treatment is up to a 70% reduction in chemicals used, which improves sustainability. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
  - Measures of Success
    - *Herbicide Use*
    - *Cost Efficiency*
    - *Crop Yield*
    - *Profitability*

  - Current Performance
    - *Blue River Technologies is still in field testing for it's See and Spray technology so there were only estimates or theoretical assumptions for the benefits of the technology*


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
